# Hey, I'm Matheo!
(in English, pronounced /məˈteɪ.oʊ/)

I have been coding since 2024.
Linux user on and off since 2022. The first Distro i used was Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04), now i use Windows 10 Pro on my laptop, and [macOS High Sierra 11 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Big_Sur) on my mid-2014 Macbook Pro.

I just mess around with Python and C++ scripting.

I've also translated [Jazz² Resurrection](https://github.com/deathkiller/jazz2-native) to Norwegian!
