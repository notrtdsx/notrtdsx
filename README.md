# Hey, I'm Matheo!
I have been coding since 2024.
Linux user since 2022. The first Distro i used was Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04), now i use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) on my laptop, and MacOS Ventura 12.7.4 on an old mid-2014 Macbook Pro.

I just mess around with Python and C++ scripting.

I've also translated [Jazz² Resurrection](https://github.com/deathkiller/jazz2-native) to Norwegian!


## What I'm working on right now
- [RoPY](https://github.com/notrtdsx/RoPY) - Shows info about a user on roblox by their User ID via the Roblox API.
- [vgde](https://github.com/notrtdsx/vgde) - Shows info about games available on the RAWG site via their API
